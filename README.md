# React Redux Tiny Router Univeral Example

npm install

npm run start

a starter for [redux-tiny-router](https://github.com/Agamennon/redux-tiny-router) 

change paths.js   universal:false, to universal:true to enable universal rendering
note that in development the css will not be processed so you will see a change when client side css loads

still porting to redux-tiny-router 0.4.0

docs todo... (not fully clean ether...)
Universal react + redux + redux-tiny-router
